Spatial-Temporal Analysis of COVID-19 Spread Using Static County Characteristics and Dynamic Mobility-Case Correlations

This research investigates the heterogeneous spread of COVID-19 across US counties by examining the relationship between static county characteristics and the dynamic correlation patterns between Google mobility data and lagged/rolling average COVID-19 case data. The study addresses why COVID-19 impacted some areas more severely than others through a novel analytical framework.


- Core Research Focus
  - Correlation Pattern Analysis:
    Computing time-series correlations between Google mobility indicators (transit, workplace, grocery) and lagged/rolling average COVID-19 case data for each county.
  - Static-Dynamic Relationship Modeling:
    Investigating how static county characteristics (demographics, healthcare resources, climate, socioeconomic factors) predict the strength and direction of mobility-case correlations.
  - Heterogeneity Assessment:
  - Quantifying regional variations in COVID-19 transmission patterns and their relationship to underlying county characteristics.


- Key Research Areas
  - Time-Series Correlation Analysis:
    Computing rolling correlations between mobility trends and 14-day rolling average case data.
    Analyzing lag structures between mobility changes and subsequent case patterns.
    Identifying temporal patterns in mobility-transmission relationships.

  - Predictive Modeling of Correlation Patterns:
    Using static county features (population density, age demographics, education levels, healthcare capacity, climate) to predict mobility-case correlation strengths.
    Developing regression models to explain why certain counties show stronger mobility-transmission relationships.
    Identifying which county characteristics amplify or dampen the mobility-case correlation.

  - Spatial Heterogeneity Analysis:
    Mapping correlation patterns across geographic regions.
    Investigating clustering of similar correlation behaviors among counties with shared characteristics.
    Analyzing urban vs. rural differences in mobility-transmission dynamics.


- Methodological Innovation
  - Two-Stage Analysis:
    First computing county-specific correlations between mobility and case data, then using these correlations as dependent variables predicted by static county characteristics.
  - Temporal Dynamics:
    Incorporating various lag structures (1-day, 14-day) to capture realistic transmission delays.
  - Multi-Modal Integration:
    Combining epidemiological time series, behavioral mobility data, and socio-demographic static variables.
